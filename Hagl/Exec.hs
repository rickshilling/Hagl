-- | At a high level, this module defines the execution of games and
--   strategies in Hagl.  The goal is that end-users should be able to write
--   strategies and execute games without understanding the gory monadic
--   details.  For many examples, see "Hagl.Examples".
--
--   Now, about the gory details...  This module defines two monad
--   transformers, `ExecM` and `StratM`.  `ExecM` maintains the current
--   execution state of the game, while `StratM` adds an additional state
--   that is local to each strategy.  Each strategy may define it's own
--   type of state, and strategies cannot affect the state of other strategies.
--
--   At the center of the monad onion is the `IO` monad, allowing both game
--   execution and strategies to do things like print output, get random
--   numbers, and look up the price of tea in Shanghai.

-- * Game execution monad
--

-- | The game execution monad.  A state monad transformer that maintains the
--   game execution state.
data ExecM g a = ExecM  { unE :: StateT (Exec g) IO a }

-- | This type class captures all monads that wrap the game execution monad,
--   providing uniform access to the game execution state.  It is similar to
--   `MonadIO` for the `IO` monad.

--
-- * Strategy monad
--

-- | The strategy monad.  A state monad transformer that maintains the personal
--   state of the player who is playing this strategy, and wraps the game
--   execution monad.  This gives strategies access to the game execution state.
